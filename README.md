Gilad Turok's research at the AlQuarashi Lab at Columbia University.

I am exploring 3D molecular structure with neural networks. Specifically I am using a novel archecterue called an Equivariant Graphical Neural Network (EGNN) and benchmarking it on Atom3D, a collection of 8 molecular datasets. I will be comparing the EGNN results to other baseline models (GNN, 3DCNN, etc).

I will also be doing some feature augmentation by adding amino-acid embeddings to my model and will be tracking how this changes performance.

Two more things: (1) I will be starting on the PSR task, an Atom3D dataset based off of CASP, the famous protein folding competition. (2) I will be experimenting will different ways to optimize hyper-parameters and will (hopefully) be trying out Optunato do so.
